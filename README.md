Just a tiny experiment, for the real application you should use https://github.com/NavyTitanium/Fake-Sandbox-Artifacts

## About
Assuming the malware you could be exposed to is checking the active processes - for reverse engineering tools and then safely shuts itself down if found - we can abuse that by pretending to be those tools.
